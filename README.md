# awesome-snarkyjs-learnings

This is a place for my experimentations with `snarkyjs`, a powerful library that helps developers build apps powered by zero-knowledge (zk) cryptography. This repository will include ideas, examples, and diagrams. I want you to know that contributions and suggestions are always welcome. Please open issues or submit pull requests with any changes you want.

## Note

These examples cover my current understanding; descriptions and explanations may change over time!
