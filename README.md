# awesome-snarkyjs-learnings

This is a place for my experimentations with `snarkyjs`, a powerful library helps developers build apps powered by zero-knowledge (zk) cryptography. This repository will include ideas, examples, and diagrams. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome. Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with any changes you'd like to see.
